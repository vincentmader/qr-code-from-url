** qr-code-from-url

This CLI utility can be used to generate QR code image files from text. It is built on top of the very nice Python module `qrcode`.

If, for example, you'd like to generate a QR code for the URL "https://v1.mader.xyz", you could use this utility in the following way:
#+begin_src shell
qr-code-from-url https://v1.mader.xyz
#+end_src

The resulting image file will then be saved to the `./out` directory.
